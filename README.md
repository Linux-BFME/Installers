# Lutris Install Scripts

Requirements:

* Linux
* Lutris

## BFME I
1. Download the bfme1.yml
2. Open a terminal at the location of your `bfme2.yml`
3. Run `lutris -i bfme1.yml`


## BFME II
1. Download the bfme1.yml
2. Open a terminal at the location of your `bfme2.yml`
3. Run `lutris -i bfme2.yml`

Note: BFME II uses the new game.dat. This prevents the need of a CD to play the game, but requires anyone else playing online has it too. See the BFME II section of [this guide](https://forums.revora.net/topic/105190-bfme1bfme2rotwk-games-download-installation-guide/) for details.
