BFME Gotchas:
   1. Two games with the same CD Key will get a "SERIAL ALREADY IN USE" error when joining a multiplayer game
   2. Changing registry "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Electronic Arts\EA Games\The Battle for Middle-earth\ergc" to fix that gives 3 minute auto-defeat

The solution (outlined https://www.gamereplays.org/community/index.php?showtopic=1010428) is to make copies of system.reg and LOTRBFMe.dat and give them to players. That's what these scripts do :)
